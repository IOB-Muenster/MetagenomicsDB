# MetagenomicsDB
MetagenomicsDB is a data management system for microbial case-control studies. It allows all researchers, regardless of their programming knowledge,
to safely store, explore, and export their study results for statistical analyses. It was developed for an ongoing prospective study of the gut microbiome of
children who are small for their gestational age.

## Website
